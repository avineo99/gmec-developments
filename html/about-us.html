                                    travelled from Swindon Wiltshire, on the train to Paddington, tube or bus across
                                    London to the slow train to Essex, We spent our days looking after Uncle George
                                    and Aunt Jess I was less than 10 on my first visit but still had chores to do to help
                                    dad and mum clean the house, sort the shed and redo the garden plan vegetables
                                    every year. It was worse when aunt Jess passed away, uncle George declined
                                    quickly

                                    Uncle George left it all to my mum and was told in the Will not to give any to the
                                    family as only my mum came to see him so she deserved it all, My mum relented
                                    and shared a fair amount of it with her brother and sister and others but kept enough
                                    to buy a nice Semi detached house for her and my dad, But even this was a direct
                                    to vendor follow deal.

                                    Dad was savy enough to transfer to me over 20 plus years ago and I became my

                                        I got divorced approx. 10 years and gave up a lot of my pension and then Carillion
                                        went bust and so my pension became almost worthless so I had to do something!!....

                                        This was my catalyst to take control of my financial future as I was just 50 and I
                                        obtained a mortgage on my mums house about 7 years ago to start my property
                                        investing career, buying a rental in Wales BRRR and then HMOS
